    <hr color="Brown">
    <p>The neighbourhood was originally known as Ayanpuram, with Ayan meaning Brahma. When Lord Muruga admonished Brahma and took over creation, it is believed that Brahma prayed to Shiva here and got his action of creativity back. It is believed that Brahma worshipped Shiva at Parasurama Easwaran Koil. It is in recognition of that Ayanpuram is named. (It was also called Brahmapuri)</p>
